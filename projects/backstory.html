          <p>Mr. Wire Mesh says: "I'm not like other wire meshes"</p>
          <p>There is much backstory to this photo, for example, the overall feeling of coldness is created, this was because it was a cold cloudy day and so, this image looks cold, like it was that day. That day was a cloudy day because the clouds were coating the sky. See, they coated the sky because on that cloudy day when I took this photo, clouds were all over the sky and no gaps were to be seen in the clouds. The clouds floated above me as I took this photo, which resulted in a dull appearance in the photo. But why do clouds float? Clouds are composed primarily of small water droplets and, if it's cold enough, ice crystals. The clear (or rather, cloudy üòâ) majority of clouds you see contain droplets and/or crystals that are too small to have any appreciable fall velocity. So the particles continue to float with the surrounding air. For an analogy closer to the ground, think of tiny dust particles that, when viewed against a shaft of sunlight, appear to float in the air. So because these tiny droplets of water, suspended in the air without enough mass to have any appreciable fall velocity would continue to float in the sky, causing my photo to be dull and yet somewhat pleasing to the eye because of this.</p>

          <p>Even in the upside down they have chinese takeout!</p>
          <p>So you want to go to the upside down: Well boi do I have news for you, guess what? No. Don‚Äôt answer that, it was rhetorical. Whilst wandering the wondrous streets of Sydney, New South Wales, I came across this blatant portal to the upside down. As I photographed this sign for ‚ÄúNobel Chinese House Cuisine‚Äù, I noticed that is was not rotated correctly‚Ä¶ Then it hit me! It‚Äôs obviously a portal, right? No god damn it! That‚Äôs another rhetorical question, don‚Äôt answer it. What else could it be, right? Another rhetorical question, buddy. You don‚Äôt need to bloody answer. Obviously it‚Äôs a portal. No one just puts a sign up upside down by mistake. Right? No, not everything I say needs to be answered. Just, QUIT IT. IT WAS RHETORICAL. So, anyway yeah, I took a photo of it and it seems the photo totally randomly rotated upside down to.</p>

          <p>So, I'm sitting is maths, doing work. I take out my phone to "calculate" something and I notice how trash my camera is. I've opened Snapchat by this point. The shutter speed is just amazingly terrible. So, yeah, I took this pic. Looks great. Just follow the steps I just told you and you should get some similar results. It's not hard. Speaking of hardness, what is it? A quick Google search defines it as "The quality or condition of being hard." As you can tell, this is very helpful. We now know that hardness involving being hard. So, to be hard, must we have some kind of relationship with it? How about if it's our last name. Then James is Hard. This seems like a loose connection, but how about other variations of the last name Hard. Hart, the German translation. Many people have this last name, it's more common than the English variant, I happen to be acquainted with a <del>Hardman</del> Hart man myself. Okay, I'm not really feeling any hard evidence here. Wikipedia will have some accurate information. "Hardness is a measure of how resistant solid matter is to various kinds of permanent shape change when a compressive force is applied." Ok, this makes sense, the more dense something is, the harder it is? So your brain is pretty hard then I guess. I'm just kidding, density and hardness are two different things. You're still dense though.</p>
