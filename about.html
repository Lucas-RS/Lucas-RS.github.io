        Well, hello there. This site is dedicated to a bunch of random stuff, be it photography, 3D modelling, other forms of digital art, maybe real life art stuff too (traditional art?). Yeah basically a bunch of art. Basically everything. Everything can considered be called art right? Music is art. 3D modelling is art. Programming is art. Literature is art. Architectur is art.

        Please validate me by enjoying my content and telling me how good I am at everything.
        <br /><b><i>"Ugh, why am I so ugly?" :(</i>
        <br />Okay, now you say: "Oh no, please don't say that about yourself, you're beautiful, Lucas"</b>
        <br /> Everyone requires validation right? We act like we don't care what other people think but in reality, the fact that that kid you don't associate with at all thinks you're cool or good looking really doesn't mean anything to you. You do things for yourself. You workout and diet properly, <i>for yourself</i>. Right? Totally. You can't be hurt by what others think! Psh, they can have whatever opinions that want. Just like me. I don't care at all what you think of me, why should I? I'm a big boy, I don't need your kind words or endorsement or approval or acceptance or affirmation or warrant or license or certification or signature or agreement. Ok that's all the synonyms for Validate.

        Please tell me I'm cool and I make cool things. It makes me feel good about myself. If you don't I'll be sad. Sad is bad. <del>Drugs not hugs</del> Hugs not drugs.
